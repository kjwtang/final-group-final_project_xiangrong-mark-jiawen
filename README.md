## Project

All of our work for the term project are in the `assignment` directory.  We worked in the `.Rmd` notebook, and commited our rendered output files (`.md` and associated files) in the `assignment` directory as well. We also uploaded some data file we used for analysis there. 

## Project overview

In this project, we were able to analyzed data and create figures to interpret the ecological crisis on Amazon forest in Brazil. We recreated maps showing the spatial distribution of major drivers of Amazonian forest degradation. We show the geo-spatial and temporal trends in deforestation of Amazon forest in Brazil. We then delved into a major driver of forest-loss: fire, and summarized its trend for various places and times. Lastly, we recreated maps showing future projection of logging and fire events in Brazil, which are expected to accelerate forest loss.
