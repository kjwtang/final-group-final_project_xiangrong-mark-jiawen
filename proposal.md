## Evaluate the Main Climate Driver of Amazon Forest Degradation

Group member: Jiawen Tang, Xiangrong (Mark) Sun

The Amazon rainforest is the single largest carbon storage ecosystem on land, and provides abundant valuable ecological services. But Amazon rainforest ecosystem has brought the burden of many ecological crisis, mostly from anthropogenic sources such as deforestation and climate change. However, many people tend to overlook the fact that anthropogenic disturbances also cause degradation of the remaining Amazon forest, posting potential future harms. Understanding the cause of forest degradation is critical to improve restoration and conservation practices in the future. To meet this goal, we will explore the causes and future of Amazon forest degradation from the perspective of climate change.

According to The article "The drivers and impacts of Amazon forest degradation" (DOI: 10.1126/science.abp8622), extreme drought and fire are two of the four main drivers of Amazon forest degradation. The data source we will be using is provided by the author of this article (https://doi.org/10.25824/redu/EGJAYI). The data includes the maps and scripts used to visualize 2001-2018 forest degradation due to major factors, as well as projections for 2019-2050 Amazon forest degradation, which are plotted for different pathways. The format of the data is divided into a minimum of 900 * 900 m to 50 * 50km depending on the resolution. The data is stored in Tag Image File Format.

The three questions we will answer and explain in our project are:
1. What are the climate drivers of the Amazon Forest Degradation, based on the observation data?
2. What are differences in the drivers of the Degradation under climate and deforestation governance (GOV) and business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios?
3. What are the estimating carbon emissions in the 2019â€“2050 period resulting from deforestation (DFT) and degradation (DGR)?

We will display in the form of maps and charts, organize and visualize relevant data (including Cluster data and spatial data), and recreate some of the maps in this article.
