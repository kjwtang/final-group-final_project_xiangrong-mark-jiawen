# Final project proposal

## Evaluate the Main Climate Driver of Amazon Forest Degradation

Group member: Jiawen Tang, Xiangrong (Mark) Sun

The Amazon rainforest is the single largest carbon storage ecosystem on land and provides extremely valuable ecological services. But the Amazon rainforest is also the fastest shrinking forest area, and there is strong evidence that human activity and climate change are playing a major role. When protecting forests, we need to understand what is worth protecting and how to do it effectively. We will explore the causes and future of Amazon forest degradation from the perspective of climate change.

According to The article "The drivers and impacts of Amazon forest degradation" (DOI: 10.1126/science.abp8622), drought and fire are two of the four main causes of Amazon forest degradation. Data source (https://doi.org/10.25824/redu/EGJAYI) to store the 2001-2018 forest degradation due to the reasons of the observed data. Projections for 2019-2050 are plotted for different pathways. The format of the data is divided into a minimum of 900 * 900 m to 50 * 50km depending on the resolution. The data is stored in Tag Image File Format.

The three questions we will answer and explain in our project are:
1. What is the climate drivers of the Amazon Forest Degradation based on the observation data?
2. What is different in the drivers of the Degradation under climate and deforestation governance (GOV) and business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios?
3. What are the estimating carbon emissions in the 2019â€“2050 period resulting from deforestation (DFT) and degradation (DGR)?

We will display in the form of maps and charts, organize and visualize relevant data (including Cluster data and spatial data), and restore graphs as much as possible.
