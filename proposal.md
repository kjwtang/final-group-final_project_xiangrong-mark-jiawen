# Final project proposal

## Evaluate the Main Climate Driver of Amazon Forest Degradation

Group member: Jiawen Tang, Xiangrong (Mark) Sun

Amazon Forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest located in the south america. Known as the lung of earth, it is the largest single carbon storage system and the largest terrestrial oxygen producer. However, this huge rain forest is facing large scale deforestation and degradation due to human activities. In this project, we will focus on Brazil's part of deforestation, finding the historical data to understand deforestation status and projecting the future.

We will be using several data sources, and replicate data from research paper to show the historical and current status of deforestation. We will also explore future forest conditions under different scenarios. The main paper we aim to replicate is https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8622, we will start with its current estimate and end with this as well. Apart from it, we will use other data sources such as fire to establish connections with deforestation. The data includes the maps and scripts used to visualize 2001-2018 forest degradation due to major factors, as well as projections for 2019-2050 Amazon forest degradation, which are plotted for different pathways. The format of the data is divided into a minimum of 900 * 900 m to 50 * 50km depending on the resolution. The data is stored in Tag Image File Format.

We will also use other Brazil Forest Datasets to plot and visualize the lost of forest, percentage of lost, and the time variation. The three questions we will answer and explain in our project are:
1. What are the climate drivers of the Amazon Forest Degradation, based on the observation data?
2. Where in Brazil is the most in deforestation happening? Who have the higher lost percentage?
3. What are the spatial and temporal hat are the future deforestation trends?

We will display in the form of maps and charts, organize and visualize relevant data (including Cluster data and spatial data), and recreate some of the maps in this article.
